      <h1 style="margin-top:90px;">Short it Out – A Comprehensive Guide to Men’s Shorts</h1>
      <p>Typically throughout history, shorts were used more for necessity than fashion and were only really used when
        you were spending time at the beach or for some form of sport.However, as the years have rolled on and fashion
        has changed along with social perceptions, shorts have now become an important part of men’s fashion for use
        outside of just sun, sand and sports. The first appearance of the knee hugging trendy pants was by
        fashion-forward-thinking Europeans and used mainly in the warmer climates. It wasn’t long before the idea
        reached the military and they redesigned shorts to create cargo shorts to allow soldiers to keep cool whilst
        maintaining the ability to cram many items into the pockets.Like many items that were adopted by the military
        they soon became extremely fashionable and many people were wearing shorts in public.<br><u
          style="font-weight: bolder;">Shorts for Every Occassion</u> The sportswear trend is in full swing and the
        sweat pant/short is a popular item of streetwear (as well as being used for leisure and lounging). The sweat
        short is a particularly casual pair of shorts, but can provide a unique urban look.To create this style you can
        pair sweat shorts with a regular or oversized fit t-shirt – a logo print or graphic t-shirt is the ideal partner
        here. Finish the look off with some vintage style running trainers and to give your outfit an edge, layer your
        top half with an open casual<br><u style="font-weight: bolder;">Chino shorts </u>are the opposite end of the
        spectrum. They are versatile and can be used for either formal or casual wear. The chino short is a summer
        staple for most men due to its versatility and ability to work well with almost any outfit<br><span
          style="font-weight: bolder;"><u>Denim Shorts</u></span>The denim short is another example of a casual or
        streetwear item, especially if they are plain blue. These shorts are a more relaxed fit generally and will hang
        around at knee level. You can find smarter denim short styles if you opt for slim/skinny fit and darker colours
        such as black.<br><span style="font-weight: bolder;"><u>Cargo Shorts</u></span>As you know, the cargo short
        first started life in the military and were designed for troops in warmer climates who still needed to be
        heavily packed. They soon became popular with the public and have stayed a prominent feature every summer
        since.Pair sand coloured cargos with a black t-shirt and all black trainers to give your outfit some eye popping
        contrast.</span></p>
